# Mood & Music
A webcam and image upload app that detects facial emotion using Parallel Dots AI API. Whatever emotion that is returned, the Napster API returns and displays the associated song. The site was styled using Materialize CSS framework and animated with jQuery UI.
---------------

## Instructions:
* Best used with Google Chrome, users must enable their browser to allow the web app to access their webcam. The app will then detect a facial emotion from taken snapshots as long as faces are clearly displayed in the frame and are backed by sufficient lighting.
* Users also have the option to upload an image file that the app can analyze. Acceptable image files are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp` and `.tiff`
